* data_init.py:          Script to initialise the various data files
* evol.py:               Script forming the bulk of the simulation. It evolves the system.
* evol_func.py:          Script consisting of various functions needed to compute physical parameters.
* file_logistics.py:     Script to organise file names.
* interface.py:          Script which starts the simulation. It consists of the parameters forming the initial conditions.
* interface.slurm:       Bash script to run simulations on the ALICE supercomputer hosted by Leiden University.
* parti_initialiser.py:  Script defining the initial conditions of the simulation.
* test.slurm:            Bash script to run test simulations on the ALICE supercomputer.
